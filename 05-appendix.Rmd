Shaded areas correspond to Bonferroni-adjusted 95% confidence intervals of mean diversity response across 10,000 random sample accumulation curves. Colored lines denote individual responses of each block. In subplot b, lines correspond to the net effects of spatial aggregation on estimated response, calculated as the observed log-response ratio relative to the median value across bootstrap samples.

### Clustering Index Ranking Methods:

The following provides brief descriptions of clustering heuristics used to evaluate K in K-medoids clustering. 

For more detail, see @Charrad2014.

* __Hartigan__: Choose value K with maximum index difference between K and K-1. 
* __CH__: Choose maximum value among orders of K considered. 
* __Beale__: Choose minimum value of K such that the critical value of the index is less than alpha = 0.05. Other values whose critical value is less than alpha are ranked in order of significance. 
* __KL__: Choose maximum value among orders of K considered. 
* __Cindex__: Choose minimum value among orders of K considered. 
* __DB__ (Davies and Bouldin): Choose minimum value among orders of K considered. 
* __Silhouette__: Choose maximum value among orders of K considered. 
* __Duda__: Choose minimum value of K such that the critical value of the index is less than alpha = 0.05. Other values whose critical value is less than alpha are ranked in order of significance.
