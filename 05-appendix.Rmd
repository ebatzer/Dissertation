Clustering Index Ranking Method:  
1. Hartigan: Choose value K with maximum index difference between K and K-1.
2. CH: Choose maximum value among orders of K considered.
3. Beale: Choose minimum value of K such that the critical value of the index is less than alpha = 0.05. Other values whose critical value is less than alpha are ranked in order of significance.
4. KL: Choose maximum value among orders of K considered.
5. Cindex: Choose minimum value among orders of K considered.
6. DB (Davies and Bouldin): Choose minimum value among orders of K considered.
7. Silhouette: Choose maximum value among orders of K considered.
8. Duda: Choose minimum value of K such that the critical value of the index is less than alpha = 0.05. Other values whose critical value is less than alpha are ranked in order of significance.
