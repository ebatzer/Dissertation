Estimated responses to these nutrients are standardized such that the total magnitude of community response to each nutrient is of unit length. The line illustrates the null hypothesis of proportionally identical responses; Species 1 (Sp1) exhibits comparatively stronger responses to N treatment than either P or K. \newline  (b) Three-dimensional representation of responses: The responses above are presented as a three-dimensional plot, with the vector y representing the null hypothesis. The vector of responses estimated for Sp1, x1, is projected onto y, producing the projection, \(a_1\), and rejection, \(b_1\). The coordinates of this projection vector, \(a_1\), correspond to the average response of Sp1 recorded across all three nutrients. Projection and rejection vectors for Sp2 and Sp3 may be calculated in a similar fashion and used to evaluate response dimensionality at the community scale. In this community, strong positive correlation across all three treatment dimensions yielded low overall response dimensionality, D = 0.04. \newline  (c) Two-dimensional plot of rejection vectors: Residual elements of the response vector not captured by projection onto y may be visualized in two dimensions, b1 and b2. Corresponding to relationships shown in bivariate plots, rejection elements of Sp1 have large values in the second rejection dimension, b2, reflecting proportionally stronger responses to N enrichment than other treatments. \relax }}{12}{figure.caption.7}\protected@file@percent }
