  The recent history of the Earth's biosphere is dominated by human activity.
  This period, considered by some to be a distinct geologic age -- the _Anthropocene_ --
  is characterized by rapid changes in the diversity and distribution of both flora 
  and fauna. Industrialization, land use change, fossil fuel combustion, and a 
  host of other drivers have altered key biological processes that govern
  the composition and function of natural communities.
  
  Like many ecologists, my dissertation explores the effects of these
  human-caused environmental changes. I chose to focus on grasslands; a highly 
  complex, dynamic ecosystem type that serve multiple roles in conservation,
  carbon sequestration, and agriculture. Grasslands cover between 30 and 40 percent
  of the earth's land area, including a large portion of California's Central Valley,
  foothill, and coastal plain environments.
  
  
  This dissertation is organized in three chapters, each exploring relationships
  between resource availability and plant community composition from a different perspective.
  
  Chapter 1 uses data from a global experimental cooperative -- the _Nutrient Network_ --
  to test hypotheses about compositional change driven by soil nutrient enrichment. While 
  classic perspectives on resource competition suggest that nutrient enrichment controls
  plant species abundances through increasing limitation by light, recent experimental evidence
  indicates that other mechanisms related to trade-offs in the use of specific soil 
  resources may also be an important driver. By comparing species responses following
  different nutrient enrichment treatments to a "neutral" model assuming identical
  patterns of change, I develop a metric to quantify this treatment-specific variation.
  
  Following chapters focus more closely on California grasslands, a highly dynamic, 
  species-rich, annual-dominated system. Chapter 2 explores the relationship
  between sampling effort and nutrient-driven biodiversity loss. In experimental studies,
  the area or duration used in sampling can have significant impacts on the 
  direction or magnitude of observed results. However, the drivers responsible for
  this _scale-dependence_ in experimental outcomes is not well understood. I expand
  upon prior studies to provide a more complete evaluation of scale-dependent effects
  by relating richness changes to impacts on community evenness and spatial distribution.
  In California grasslands, I find that nitrogen enrichment rarely produces large-scale
  species extirpation, but effects on evenness are nearly constant across sampling areas.
  
  In Chapter 3, I
