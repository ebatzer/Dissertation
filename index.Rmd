  The recent history of the Earth's biosphere is dominated by human activity.
  Considered by some to be a distinct geologic age -- the _Anthropocene_ -- this period
  is characterized by rapid changes in the diversity and distribution of both flora 
  and fauna. Industrialization, land use change, fossil fuel combustion, and a 
  host of other drivers have altered key biological processes that govern
  the composition and function of natural communities. Among the two most impactful 
  stressors are the increased concentrations of limiting soil nutrients -- including 
  plant-available nitrogen, phosphorous, and other micronutrients -- and shifting
  patterns of temperature and precipitation through climate change. 
  
  Human-driven changes in soil nutrients and climate dynamics can be viewed through the 
  lens of resource availability -- the growth of photosynthetic organisms is often controlled 
  by the same set of factors, so changes to the distribution of limiting resources can
  disrupt the core processes that allow species to coexist. While all ecosystems
  may be expected to respond to these changes in some capacity, effects are best
  captured in systems that are sensitive to many drivers: I chose to focus on grasslands. 
  Grasslands cover between 30 and 40 percent of the earth's land area, including 
  a large portion of California's Central Valley, foothills, and coastal plains. 
  Their ubiquity and importance to both conservation and human enterprise underscores
  the need to predict how grassland systems will change in coming years.
  
  This dissertation is organized in three chapters, each exploring relationships
  between resource availability and plant community composition from a different perspective.
  
  Chapter 1 uses data from a global experimental cooperative -- the _Nutrient Network_ --
  to test hypotheses about compositional change driven by soil nutrient enrichment. While 
  classic perspectives on resource competition suggest that nutrient enrichment controls
  plant species abundances through increasing limitation by light, recent experimental evidence
  indicates that other mechanisms related to trade-offs in the use of specific soil 
  resources may also be an important driver. By comparing species responses following
  different nutrient enrichment treatments to a "neutral" model assuming identical
  patterns of change, I develop a metric to quantify this treatment-specific variation. 
  Across sites, a one-dimensional pattern of change appears dominant, indicating that
  the growth strategies of grassland plants tend to increase performance under low
  or high resource environments, generally.
  
  Following chapters focus more closely on California grasslands. 
  Chapter 2 explores the relationship between sampling effort and nutrient-driven 
  biodiversity loss. In experimental studies, the area or duration used in 
  sampling can have significant impacts on the  direction or magnitude of 
  observed results. However, the drivers responsible for this _scale-dependence_ 
  in experimental outcomes is not well understood. I expand
  upon prior studies to provide a more complete evaluation of scale-dependent effects
  by relating richness changes to impacts on community evenness and spatial distribution.
  In California grasslands, I find that nitrogen enrichment rarely produces large-scale
  species extirpation, but effects on evenness are nearly constant across sampling areas.
  While large-scale coexistence processes may facilitate species persistence at large
  spatial extents, fertilization also appears to prompt increases in the spatial 
  aggregation of individuals, which may produce species extirpation in the long term. 
  
  In Chapter 3, I evaluate changes in California grassland community composition 
  in response to a different dimension of resource availability: interannual 
  variation in temperature and precipitation. In Mediterranean systems, summer droughts
  act as an important stressor that is hypothesized to control turnover between
  distinct species groups. A key challenge to the evaluation of these species-climate
  relationships, however, is historical contingency in vegetation composition --
  non-independence between species abundances in a given year and the year previous, 
  caused by local seed pools, plant-soil feedbacks, and other priority effects. To 
  quantify how climate and priority interact, I employed a novel application of 
  multi-state modeling to a long-term dataset capturing shifts in species abundances
  during a period of wide-ranging variation in drought stress. I found that vegetation
  change over time could be effectively captured through changes through several 
  discrete community types, including an assemblage distinct from "classic" 
  descriptions of vegetation dynamics. These states exhibited varied in their 
  responses to drought stress and probability of transitioning to one another. Communities
  dominated by invasive species, for example, performed poorly under severe drought,
  but rarely transitioned to a native-dominated community when these species were 
  seeding in previous years.
